tl;dr: Activity tracker data analysis app for Android and iOS

If you want to get back all your running, cycling, ... tracking data and analyse it yourself, 
this app could be interesting for you one day. Currently, we are in early alpha stage, so we thought,
let's just share some screenshots to get folks interested:
